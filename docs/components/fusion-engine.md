## 🎨 Vision Processing: CLIP + BLIP

### CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)

#### What It Does
**Scene understanding and threat classification** through vision-language alignment.

#### Technical Details
- **Model**: ViT-Base (85M parameters) for Tier 1, ViT-Large (307M parameters) for Tier 2
- **Training**: 400M image-text pairs from the web
- **Capability**: Zero-shot classification without task-specific training

#### In TriFusion
```python
# Scene classification example
scene_classes = [
    "normal living room", "violent confrontation", "person falling",
    "medical emergency", "peaceful activity", "threatening situation"
]

# CLIP analyzes the scene
scene_probabilities = clip_classifier(frame, scene_classes)
threat_score = scene_probabilities["violent confrontation"] + scene_probabilities["medical emergency"]
```

#### Why It Matters
- **Context Awareness**: Knows the difference between a person exercising vs. having a medical emergency
- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Can classify new threat types without retraining
- **Fast Inference**: Sub-50ms processing for real-time operation

### BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)

#### What It Does
**Detailed image captioning and description** for comprehensive visual understanding.

#### Technical Details
- **Architecture**: Vision Transformer + BERT-based language model
- **Training**: 129M image-text pairs with bootstrapping
- **Capability**: Generate detailed, contextual image descriptions

#### In TriFusion
```python
# Detailed scene description
caption = blip_model.generate_caption(frame)
# Example output: "An elderly person lying on the kitchen floor, appearing unconscious with a spilled cup nearby"
```

#### Why It Matters
- **Rich Context**: Provides detailed scene descriptions for AI reasoning
- **Injury Assessment**: Can describe visible injuries or medical conditions
- **Environmental Context**: Notes surroundings that affect situation severity

```python
# Tier 1: Fast keyword detection
tiny_transcript = whisper_tiny.transcribe(audio_chunk)
if "help" in tiny_transcript.lower() or "emergency" in tiny_transcript.lower():
    trigger_tier2()

# Tier 2: Complete analysis
full_transcript = whisper_large.transcribe(full_audio_buffer)
emotion_analysis = analyze_emotion(full_transcript)
context_understanding = understand_situation(full_transcript)
```

### Why It Matters
- **Distress Detection**: Instantly identifies emergency calls

    "aggressive_movement": detect_aggression(pose_landmarks, velocity),
    "distress_position": detect_distress_pose(pose_landmarks),
    "unusual_posture": detect_abnormal_posture(pose_landmarks)
}
```

#### Movement Analysis
- **Velocity Tracking**: Monitors speed of body part movements
- **Acceleration Detection**: Identifies sudden changes indicating emergencies
