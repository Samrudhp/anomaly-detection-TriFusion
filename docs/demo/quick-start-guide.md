## üöÄ Step 1: Environment Setup (2 minutes)

### 1.1 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samrudhp/anomaly-2.git
cd anomaly-2/backend
```

**What you see:**
- Repository downloads to your local machine
- You navigate into the `backend` directory
- Terminal shows: `anomaly-2/backend %`

### 1.2 Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**What you see:**
- No immediate output (success)
- A new `venv/` directory appears in your project folder

**What this does:**
- Creates an isolated Python environment
- Prevents conflicts with system Python packages
- Keeps TriFusion's dependencies separate

### 1.3 Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

**What you see:**
- Terminal prompt changes to: `(venv) anomaly-2/backend %`
- The `(venv)` prefix confirms activation

**What this means:**
- You're now using the virtual environment's Python
- Any packages you install will be isolated here

### 1.4 Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What you see:**
- Progress bars as packages download and install
- Messages like:
  ```
  Collecting fastapi==0.112.0
  Collecting torch==2.1.0
  Collecting transformers==4.35.0
  ...
  Successfully installed 45 packages
  ```

**What this installs:**
- **FastAPI**: Web server framework
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision for video processing
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face models (CLIP, BLIP)
- **Whisper**: OpenAI speech recognition
- **MediaPipe**: Human pose detection
- **Groq**: AI reasoning API client

**Time taken:** ~2-3 minutes depending on internet speed

### 1.5 Setup API Configuration
```bash
# Create .env file
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env
```

**What you see:**
- No output (file created successfully)

**What this does:**
- Creates environment configuration file
- Stores your Groq API key securely
- Enables AI reasoning capabilities
